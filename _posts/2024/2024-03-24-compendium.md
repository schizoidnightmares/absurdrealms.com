The compendium, the official in-universe guide to *Absurd Realms*, intended to replace the now defunct Schizoid Nightmares Wiki, is now available [here](/compendium/).

**Updated April 28, 2024: I have removed the log page in favour of just linking to the GitHub folder.**

It is currently barebones and will remain an incremental work in progress. I log changes to the compendium <a href="https://github.com/schizoidnightmares/absurdrealms.com/tree/master/compendium" target="_blank">here</a>.
