title: Proscribe v. Prescribe
description: I confused proscribed with prescribed
---

In the third scene of "[The Gorge](/anthology-i/the-gorge/)," "[Lonely Among the Clouds](/anthology-i/the-gorge/lonely-among-the-clouds/)," I made the embarrassing mistake of confusing "proscribed" with "prescribed."

Both words are, in fact, opposites. *Proscribe* means to prohibit, while *prescribe* means to authorize. In the context of the scene I originally wrote (emphasis added on the relevant part):
> "The needs of the Polity override those of the individual. Even before the conquests, the Council ruled successfully since the founding of Heaven’s Sanctuary. It is their continued success, **proscribed** in the Heaven’s Mandate, that legitimizes their perpetual reign."

The original paragraph doesn't make sense. If the continued success of the Council is *proscribed* (i.e. prohibited), then being successful wouldn't legitimize their reign. And, also, why would an organization's ethos prohibit its own success...

I have now corrected this typo:
> "It is their continued success, ***prescribed*** in the Heaven’s Mandate, that legitimizes their perpetual reign."

Despite using and paying for <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank">Grammarly ⧉</a> to proofread my work, it doesn't catch everything. One of its evolving limits is understanding the intent/context behind a statement. With better A.I. in the future, this hopefully will improve. That being said, I cannot ever expect it to replace the quality of a human proofreader. However, it is cheaper and more efficient.
