Due to my initial misunderstanding of licensing terms, I decided to remove the AI generated reading of "Birthing Pool," which was a placeholder for a future human-voiced reading anyway.

I paid for the premium service of ElevenLabs, which includes commercial use rights. Unfortunately, the same permission applied to me does not extend to others (i.e. I cannot sub-license it for others to use).

While I didn't have to remove it publicly outright, I feel the licensing for the audio file would be too confusing given my other work is under permissive licensing. In the future, once I get an audiobook version of my written work done by a professional, I will of course make sure it can be released under CC BY 4.0.

I still find ElevenLabs very useful, since I can use it to hear what my writing sounds like by a fairly believable voice. However, beyond private use, I will not use for it anything else moving forward.
