"Exodus" is the fourth short story in *[Anthology I](/anthology-i/)*. Four centuries have passed since the events of "[The Gorge](/anthology-i/the-gorge/)," the rapidly expanding Heaven's Empire nears world domination, threatening the future of the King's Republic.

It is currently a work in progress.
