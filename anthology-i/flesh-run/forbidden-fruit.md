As I crawl through the slitted passage, I feel its fleshy membrane gently collapse behind my feet. The smell becomes sweeter and a tad bit pungent. It becomes evermore concentrated in the passage as the membrane seals behind me. I push myself forward, using my feet against the membrane. In the faint warm light ahead, I see only the dark outline of a figure crawling out of the passage in front of me. I am the last in and the last out.

Following right after, I pull on the edges of the opening, sliding myself smoothly out, covered in now a thick layer of muculent slime. We are in a circular cavity. A slow pulsating warm glow permeates through the enclosing membrane. In the centre is a muscular tree-like growth. Red glowing polyps form its dense crown. When I look at them, I salivate. Their sweet scent fills my mouth and throat, tantalizing me closer.

A firm hand squeezes my shoulder. It’s *Lucky*. They shake their head at me and point to a figure lying on the ground near the growth. I recognize them from our group. They lie still. Their face is bloated. Their eyes and lips are swollen shut. I do not see or hear them breathing. The others watch them. The floor soon swallows their body, leaving no remains. There are eight of us now.

*Lucky* tries to stop the others from approaching the growth, but one pushes them aside, licking their own lips. *Elbowed* then steps forward, spits in *Lucky*’s face, and elbows them hard in the shoulder as they brush past. The others follow as *Lucky* looks on helplessly. I try creeping past *Lucky*, but they block me with their arm. They point towards the growth as the others approach it. Despite *Lucky*’s pleading grunts, they ignore them.

A rattling sound emits from the growth as the others close in. One of them reaches for a polyp. The polyps quiver as their hand nears. *Lucky* keeps pointing intently at the growth, and they shake their finger. A keratin vine emerges from behind the polyps. On its tip, a rattle shakes rapidly and loudly.

The vine hovers near the impending hand. Undeterred, the hand tries to grasp a polyp. Drool drips from my lips as I stare. A stinger emerges from the vine’s tip. The vine springs at the hand and punctures through it. *Stung* screeches in pain and jumps back, clutching their hand. Tears stream down their face. Their hand swells up fast, and the swelling travels down their arm. The others, including *Elbowed*, pay no attention and rip off polyps from the growth, spared of the distracted vine. They sink their teeth into the juicy polyps and devour them.

*Stung* falls over, convulsing and crying silently. I watch the others with burning jealousy. They lick the leftover juices from their lips. My heart pounds, and my mouth drools for a fresh red polyp. The rattle cannot inhibit me any longer. I rush forward, not letting *Lucky* get a chance to hold me back. As I scurry by the growth, I quickly yank off a polyp, and the rattling vine launches after me. I feel a rush of air against the back of my shoulder. The vine barely missed me.

While I consume the polyp, I see the satiated others submerge into the floor. I close my eyes, enjoying the luscious sweet taste. Juice squirts from the polyp on my cheeks. I gather what I can with my fingers and lick my face clean. *Lucky* watches from across the room, their eyes darting between the growth, *Stung*, and I. My muscles tighten and relax. A serene wave flows through me. First, my toes sink into the floor, and then gradually, the rest of me. Just as the membrane fully engulfs me, I see *Lucky* creep toward the growth. *Stung* stumbles to their feet, their swollen arm limp. I close my eyes as the membrane rolls over my head.
