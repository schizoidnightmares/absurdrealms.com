Over the lip and into the warming glow, I go, sliding down a fleshy funnel into a soothing and muculent river below. The current carries me along, and I drift comfortably at the surface. My skin feels slithery smooth, and tenderly soft, with not a trace of stinging. The glow dims from the funnel above as I drift into a tunnel lined with a fleshy membrane, like all the other surfaces.

I can barely see anything. My shoulder rubs up against the slimy rounded wall of the tunnel. I must be drifting around a bend. There are muffled moans and groans from an indeterminate distance ahead. Around the bend, I see a faint warm glow. Small waves ripple gently past me.

The tunnel opens into a cavity raised above the river. A giant pulsating udder hangs overhead. A warm glow shines down a slit that encircles the base of the udder. There are dozens of other tunnels, all flowing into the cavity where the river ends. A figure ahead of me from one of the other tunnels crawls out of the river and shuffles up the cavity’s shore.

There are more of them, no more than a dozen. They gather under the udder, reaching up at its inviting teats. A lucky one grabs hold of one and tries to suck the luscious teat. The others grab the lucky one, trying to climb them to get to the teat. *Lucky* elbows one of the grabbers in the face. The elbowed grabber yells and shrieks, their voice breaking, and spits as the others push them away.

*Elbowed* sits and snivels, burying their face in their palms. I crawl past them out of the river. *Lucky* brawls with the others and kicks one aside. Wheezing, they all fall down, some on top of each other. I push myself onto my feet and wobble underneath the udder, narrowly avoiding stepping on the others. I can barely keep my balance.

The udder hangs there, so inviting. My mouth waters just looking at it. My stomach growls. I imagine my lips around one of the teats, sucking. I can practically feel the milk lather my throat.

Before I lift my arms up to its delectable teats, I feel hands grasp up my leg. *Lucky* and the others use me like a vine. I try to keep my legs straight, but I am no match for their combined weight. They clamber over me, and I collapse beneath them.

The others trample my body with no concern, using me to step up towards the teats. *Lucky* is again the first to grab a teat and suckle its delicious milk. Satiated, *Lucky* steps off me, letting go of the teat, its milk dripping down on us. I, and the others, lick up all the spilled milk we can get.

After some quick tastes, I compose myself and roll onto my rear. The others still suckle away at the milk residue on the fleshy floor. *Lucky* stands before me, they drool, and their eyelids remain half closed. I see their feet start to sink into the floor like mud. Soon, the floor swallows their ankles, then their knees, and their thighs. Now they're down to their waist. *Lucky* has the same expression on their face, seemingly unperturbed or too quenched to care. They sink further down into the flesh. I just sit there and watch as the floor swallows them down whole, leaving no hole or other trace. I lean forward and lightly touch where they sank. It feels no different, not more squishy or solid than the rest of the floor.

I glance up at the udder. Its teats are more inviting than ever. My heart races to meet one with my lips. The others still fight over the dribbles on the floor. I step on one of them, pushing my toes down into their spine to get a good grip. A loud shriek. I must be on top of *Elbowed*. I recognize their sharp voice. I quickly grab the closest teat and yank it to my lips.

At last, the teat is mine! *Elbowed*, and the others groan and holler. I suckle on the teat like a baby. I don't want to waste a single drop. The milk lathers my throat and fills my belly. A placating tidal wave flows through my body. I am suddenly pushed off of *Elbowed* by the others as they scramble on top of them. *Elbowed* wails and writhes against the ground. Milk drips down from the suckled teat, sprinkling us in droplets.

My body starts sinking into the ground, despite the others being unaffected. The fleshy membrane feels slithery and soft against my skin as it engulfs me. I don't panic. I just let it all happen...
