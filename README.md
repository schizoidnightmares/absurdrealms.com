## Content warning
As per [GitHub's terms on user safety](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#2-user-safety), I declare that some images in /assets/images/ contain fictional (i.e. illustrated) depictions of blood, gore, and suggestive imagery for artistic purposes. Some users may also find other creative content and themes present undesirable. Keep in mind that this repository relates to fictional works, [not real representations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM-e46xdcUo).
