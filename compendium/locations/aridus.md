# Aridus
Desert
{: .cap}

**Aridus** is the desert of the [Main Westlands](/compendium/locations/main-westlands/). Wind erosion formed it during [Late Genesis](/compendium/events/genesis/#late-genesis) in [460 million BW](/compendium/events/genesis/#461-million-bw) with its [central](/compendium/locations/central-aridus/), [northern](/compendium/locations/northern-aridus/), and [southern](/compendium/locations/southern-aridus/) geographic regions. It's east of the [Westland Belt](/compendium/locations/westland-belt/) and stretches to the mainland's eastern coast.
