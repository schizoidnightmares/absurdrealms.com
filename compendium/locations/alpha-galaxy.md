{: .cap}

The **Alpha Galaxy** is a barred spiral galaxy in the [Alpha Group](/compendium/locations/alpha-group/). It formed as a solitary galaxy in the [Alpha Supercluster](/compendium/locations/alpha-supercluster/) during [Early Genesis](/compendium/events/genesis/#early-genesis) in [2.65 billion BW](/compendium/events/genesis/#265-billion-bw) before becoming part of the initial Alpha Group in [2.27 billion BW](/compendium/events/genesis/#227-billion-bw). As a barred spiral galaxy, it has two major spiral arms, one of which is the [Alpha Arm](/compendium/locations/alpha-arm/).
