It formed during [Early Genesis](/compendium/events/genesis/#early-genesis) as a solitary galaxy in the [Alpha Supercluster](/compendium/locations/alpha-supercluster/) in 2.65 billion BW before becoming part of the initial Alpha Group in 2.27 billion BW. As a barred spiral galaxy, it has two major spiral arms, one of which is the [Alpha Arm](/compendium/locations/alpha-arm/).
