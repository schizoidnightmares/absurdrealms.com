The **Alpha Supercluster** is the supercluster containing the [Alpha Group](/compendium/locations/alpha-group/). It formed in the [Cosmos](/compendium/locations/cosmos/) during [Early Genesis](/compendium/events/genesis/#early-genesis) in [2.72 billion BW](/compendium/events/genesis/#272-billion-bw). The supercluster became part of the initial [Great Thread](/compendium/locations/great-thread/) in [2.66 billion BW](/compendium/events/genesis/#266-billion-bw).
